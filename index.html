                    This is going to take me like an hour or Two (I said to myself)<br>
                But behold, when I stepped on my machine, I felt empty (as in blank). The whole process appeared to me like a matrix of enless characters (lol)<br>
            So, I decided to just start anyways<br>
        PS: I gave myself a 2 hour limit and had a heavy breakfast(giggling)</p></div>

                        <P>I started by going to my github account to create the repo and do the cloning to my pc, afterwhich, I just tried to free my mind and start coding.<br>
                    I did find my way throught the html site of it after some deep thoughts and remeniscing. I tried as much not to google, cuz I believed I have what it takes to finish this project in No time<br>
                    HTML was the easy one I must say, it took me no time to draft ouot my tags</P>

                        <p>In my perspective, this is where the real work starts<br>
                    CSS has always been so complicated to me is some crazy way. My major problem has always been with estimation of the right value which will fit into the space I want, and when I used to watch tutorials when studying, I'll see someone typing out some crazy mixed up digits off-hand and it brings up a beautiful color or places the item at a very accurate position and everything looks good<br>
                    Me thinking to myself(How the hell does he know all these off-hand, will I ever arrive there). It all felt daunting to me<br>
                    I started mine by coping color codes from the colorwheel, referring to some old tasks I did to see how I could get myself out of this nightmare (lol). So Here is what I came up with after some crazy hell time</p>

                    <div class="text"><p>This page is all about the great JavaScript<br>
                    I think is was somewhat tough because I started studying JavaScript just a week ago. I must say I tried my Best</p>

                    <div class="text"><p>Task successfully completed
                        <br>
                        I was supposed to use 2 hours to finish the project, but I failed because total hours used was ~= 6hrs.<br>
                        This means I haven't totally mastered the course yet and need more work.
